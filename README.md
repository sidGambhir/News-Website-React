We consume a lot of news on a daily basis. Amidst all the hustle, we are not always able to read a full article. Most of the times when we see an interesting headline we tend to read that article, but reading into the article for a few minutes we get to know that the headline was just a clickbait. If summary is provided then it would provide a user with better decision making.

In our daily life while traveling, meeting people we see some headlines or overhear people discussing some topic of current affairs and we find that topic interesting. We would like to know the latest news of that topic but not many websites are present that give us the latest top headlines in sorted order for a topic. It is a hassle to gather all the information regarding a topic from a website .

Most of the websites provide news either in English, Hindi or any other regional language. None of the English websites provide translation for the news into Hindi. This makes it difficult for people to understand the news from reputed and reliable sources which only provide news in English. Majority of the Indian population would like to read news from these reputed sources.

To solve all of these problems, we have incorporated a number of features on our website. 

Firstly, to save time of our users, we extract the summary of the relevant news articles using state-of-the-art text summarization model, namely, Facebook bart-large-cnn. This provides a crisp and accurate summary of all the news articles, keeping the users from reading long and cumbersome articles.

Second problem which we intend to solve is the classification of news articles according to the userâ€™s choice. The categories include general, business, science, entertainment, sports and technologies. The users can filter out the latest news from any of the mentioned categories and consume the news of their choice!

Finally, we tried to mitigate the language barrier by providing an option to translate the extracted news summary to Hindi. Now the users can read their choice of news article in the language of their choice! This will make our website accessible to a larger audience. Now even more people can experience the better way of browsing the news.
